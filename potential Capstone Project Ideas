Below are three potential projects

1. Machine Learning based ZZAlpha Ltd. Stock Recommendations 2012-2014 Data Set [UCI Machine Learning Repository]
  Dataset - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Machine+Learning+based+ZZAlpha+Ltd.+Stock+Recommendations+2012-2014
  
  A relevant paper - https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Proof-Protocol-for-a-Machine-Learning-Technique-in-Pratt/7a354f93a27a733d207219b033be7c272a220f77

  Initial thought: With stock recommendataion, can a model be built to increase short term return of a portfolio?

2. Deutsche BÃ¶rse Public Data Set [Registry of Open Data on AWS]
  Dataset: https://registry.opendata.aws/deutsche-boerse-pds/
  
  A relevant paper: https://github.com/Originate/dbg-pds-tensorflow-demo  
  
  Initial thought: Explore if we can use the dataset to make predictions about future price movements.

3. Chicago Crime Dataset
  Dataset: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2

  Initial thought: Predict the type of crime.

5.Default of credit card clients from [UCI Machine Learning Repository]

  Dataset - http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients

  A relevant paper - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417407006719

  Initial thought: With the given dataset, I am very interested in building a predictive model for what type of clients may get default on their credit card payment.   

6. Detect Malaciou Exectable (AntiVirus) Data Set from [UCI Machine Learning Repository]
  
  Dataset - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Detect+Malacious+Executable(AntiVirus)
  
  A relevant paper - http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume7/kolter06a/kolter06a.pdf
  
  Initial thought: With the given dataset, it seems that we can find a way to classify malacious executables.
