# Capstone - Data Analysis on Chicago Crime Dataset with Census Information

The Chicago Data Portal publishes a dataset reflecting reported incidents of crime that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to August 2018. 

In this project, I have examined the data, conducted data wrangling, utilized different charts to identify general trends for the crime cases in Chicago, and applied inferential statistics techniques to the data. Further, I conducted broader correlation analyses between the crime cases and demographic factors such as population, eduction, unemployment etc.  In the last part of the project, I have applied some supervised machine learning techniques to the data and built a predictive model between the crime rate per community area and these demographic factors. In addition, I have also utilized an unsupervised machine learning technique to label community areas in Chicago and identify a cluster having the highest average crime rate.

The Chicago city government would be the clients for this project. They can use my analysis report to understand the impact of demographic factors on crime rates, and which factors play critical roles in crime rates. They can also use the built model to identify the crime rate for a community area, and focus on a group of community areas with the highest average crime rate. Subsequently, they can mobilize resources more efficiently and effectively, and improve relevant areas in reducing the crime rate for a community area.
